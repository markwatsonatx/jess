Jess is a Serveless and GUI-less app developed on top of [IBM API Connect](https://developer.ibm.com/apiconnect/) and [OpenWhisk](https://developer.ibm.com/openwhisk/).

It's a super simple budget tracking app that uses text messages and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/). You send Jess
text messages detailing your budget and any additions or subtractions to that budget. Jess responds with your current
balance:

Note: Jess is experimental and using experimental services from Bluemix. It was developed for fun, and I wouldn't be surprised if may encounter the occasional hiccup. If you do please let me know!
